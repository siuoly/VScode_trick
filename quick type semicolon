Because everytime needing move right hand to key '→' and ';' when I completely key a line , I want to omit the action .

1.click in left down gear.  choice "延伸模組" , search "Colonize" ,and install it.
2.test your porgram . 
  
  If it don't work :.....
    3.type "ctrl + k" , and "ctrl + s".
    4.In search field , type "ctrl + k" , and your in "record key situation" .
    5.type "shift + enter" ,and you will see "Colonize......" in command field.
    6.right click on other command , remove it ,because the others command conflict with your setting.  Just maintain "Colonize..." command.
    
    then test "shift +enter". If it work, you success.
    Then repeat step3,4 , type "alt + endter" , "ctrl + alt + enter" ,and remove others conflicted command.
